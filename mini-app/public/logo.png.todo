A stylized logo featuring a stylized bear silhouette on the left side, representing BTC, and a stylized bull silhouette on the right side, representing ETH. The bear is in a muted gray tone, the bull in a vibrant teal. Between them, a dynamic arrow points from the bear to the bull, symbolizing the battle. The background is a clean white gradient that fades from light gray at the top to white at the bottom. The overall composition is balanced, with the text “BTC vs ETH” in a bold, modern sans‑serif font centered below the silhouettes. The logo should be clear and legible at small sizes, with a subtle drop shadow around the silhouettes to give depth.
