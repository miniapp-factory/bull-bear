+"Write a complete, working React.js mini-app code for 'BTC vs ETH Battle', a simple crypto prediction game. Use the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time BTC and ETH prices in USD (update every 5 seconds via setInterval) and calculate the BTC/ETH price ratio to determine the 'winner' (if ETH gains more vs BTC, bull wins; else, bear). Display bear mascot for BTC (use a simple SVG or emoji) on left and bull for ETH on right. Center: real-time line chart using Recharts or Chart.js showing BTC/ETH ratio over last 1 minute. Top: 20-second countdown timer (use useState and useEffect); when it hits 0, evaluate the round. User picks BTC or ETH via two buttons; if correct (chosen asset prevails in ratio change), award 10 points. Show win/loss feedback. Top-right: points display. Bottom: Connect with Privy (use @privy-io/react-auth for wallet login) and Twitter OAuth (use react-twitter-login or similar). Handle API errors and loading states. Dark theme CSS with crypto colors (orange for BTC, green for ETH), responsive for mobile. Include all imports, components, and a main App.js file. No backend needed; all client-side."
